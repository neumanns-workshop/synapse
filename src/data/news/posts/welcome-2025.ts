    "Hi, I'm Jared, the developer. Thank you for playing my first game, Synapse! It is in beta until June 30th, 2025. Afterward, you can make an account (if you have a beta code, you're good to go), but already you can:\n\n• Play daily challenges\n• Play any number of challenge links\n• Play a couple of free random games after you're done with the daily\n• Earn achievements, complete word collections, and compare with your friends\n• Report any feedback via the Contact form in the menu.\n\nOne of my hopes is that you have so much fun that you brag and compete with your friends and family.\n\nAnother hope is that you enjoy the game enough to stick around to make an account for infinite games, past daily challenges, and cloud syncing across devices.\n\nFinally, my most sincere hope is that you play enough to become familiar with just this simple semantic terrain to better understand how AI brains understand us.\n\nThanks again, and let's get those synapse firing!",
