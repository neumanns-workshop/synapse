    "Hi, I'm Jared, creator of Synapse! \n\nWelcome to the word game where you navigate pathways between connected words! Synapse visualizes semantic connections from AI language models as an interactive graph you can actually see and navigate. Choose your path through connected words, backtrack when needed, and discover multiple routes to your destination. You're not guessing blindly. You're exploring a map of meaning and discovering how well your intuition aligns with AI's understanding of language.\n\nStart Here:\n• Try a Daily Challenge to get the feel\n• Play a couple of free random games\n• Earn achievements, complete word collections, and compare with your friends\n• Check out Lab to see experimental features\n\nI created this because I love word games but wanted something that engages with language in a deeper way. Play a few rounds and let me know what you think! Your feedback helps shape the future of semantic gaming.\n\nHappy pathfinding!",
