# Synapse: Semantic Pathways - Implementation Plan

## 1. Project Overview

"Synapse: Semantic Pathways" is a word navigation game where players use semantic relationships between words to find a path from a source word to a target word through a graph-based network. Players navigate by choosing from the top-k most similar words at each step, trying to advance toward the target word in as few moves as possible. The game visualizes the journey through a semantic space, creating an experience analogous to neural pathways forming connections in the brain.

## 2. Core Components

### 2.1 Data Preparation
- **Word Embeddings**: Process and compress pre-trained word embeddings for the 4,000-word vocabulary
- **Graph Construction**: Generate a directed graph by calculating top-k similar words for each word
- **Similarity Calculations**: Pre-compute similarity scores as edge weights in the graph
- **t-SNE Visualization**: Generate 2D coordinates for visualizing the semantic space

### 2.2 Game Logic
- **Path Finding**: Implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm to determine optimal paths.
- **Graph Traversal**: Logic for navigating the pre-computed word graph.
- **Scoring System**: Comparison of player moves against optimal path length.
- **Difficulty Scaling**: Word pairs selected based on optimal path length constraints (e.g., 2-15 moves).

### 2.3 User Interface
- **Game Screen**: Display start/target/current word. Neighbor options ordered by similarity with rank-based gradient hint.
- **Graph Visualization**: Basic SVG plot showing t-SNE positions of relevant nodes. Connects nodes in player path. On give-up, shows optimal/suggested paths and allows toggling path visibility combinations (Player/Optimal, Player/Suggested, Optimal/Suggested).
- **Path Tracking**: Inline display (word -> word) of the player's journey.
- **Status Display**: Shows Target, Moves, Best score possible from current location (`Possible in: Z`), and Accuracy (with tooltips).
- **Post-Game Report**: Detailed analysis displayed on Win/Give Up, including accuracy, semantic distance, greedy moves, and repositioning moves. Styled to match application theme.
- **Definition Tooltips:** Display WordNet definitions on hover for neighbor words, words in the path display, and the target word to reveal polysemy.

## 3. Technical Architecture

### 3.1 Frontend Stack
- **Framework**: React (using Vite for build tooling)
- **Visualization**: D3.js (Switched from basic SVG)
- **Styling**: CSS (`App.css`, refactored from inline styles)
- **State Management**: React Context API (GraphDataContext, GameContext)

### 3.2 Data Storage
- **Graph Structure**: Adjacency list representation of the word graph (`graph.json`) - Includes integrated t-SNE coordinates.
- **Edge Weights**: Pre-computed similarity scores between connected words (Stored in `graph.json`).
- **Optimal Paths**: Pre-calculated shortest paths for common word pairs
- **t-SNE Coordinates**: Pre-calculated 2D positions for visualization
- **Word Definitions:** Pre-computed WordNet definitions for all vocabulary words (`definitions.json`).

### 3.3 Optimization Techniques
- **Data Compression**: Quantized word vectors to reduce file size (Future possibility)
- **Lazy Loading**: Load only necessary data for current game (Handled by initial fetch)
- **Caching**: Store frequently accessed data in memory (React state/context provides caching)

- Analyze graph properties to confirm navigability
- Store graph in optimized format for client-side use (`graph.json`)

### 5.2 Visualization Performance
**Challenge**: Rendering and updating the graph visualization efficiently, including on mobile.
**Solution**:
- Implemented using D3.js with enter/update/exit pattern.
- ViewBox calculation adjusts zoom/pan based on relevant nodes, with responsive padding.
- Basic transitions added.
- Pre-calculate layout positions using t-SNE.
- Combined path rendering logic corrected (`getNodeClass`, `getLinkClass`).
- Canvas rendering still a future possibility if needed.

### 5.3 Pathfinding Optimization
**Challenge**: Computing optimal paths efficiently at runtime
**Solution**:
- Implement optimized Dijkstra's or A* algorithms for graph traversal (Dijkstra's implemented)
- ~~Pre-compute common paths during data preparation~~ (*Decision: On-demand calculation*)
- Use heuristics based on t-SNE coordinates to guide A* search (Future possibility if Dijkstra too slow)
- Cache path calculation results for repeated queries (Not currently needed)

### 5.4 Graph Connectivity
**Challenge**: Ensuring the graph is navigable and all word pairs are connected
**Solution**:
- Run connectivity analysis during graph construction (Not done, currently handled by retrying in `startGame` with path length/visual distance constraints)
- Add additional edges if needed to ensure full connectivity (Not done)
- Calculate graph statistics like diameter and average path length (Not done)
- Identify and address any isolated clusters of words (Not done)
